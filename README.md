Ryepdx's API
===

A personal API implemented in Flask. Provides a layer of abstraction around ryepdx's services.

Please note that I'm approaching this as an experiment. In no way should you expect my personal API to stay static for very long, nor should you ever expect it to be pretty or elegant. I reserve the right to change endpoints all willy-nilly, especially during caffeine-fueled bouts of excitement and tomfoolery.

With that said, every endpoint has a human-readable representation and a machine-readable representation. Human-readable representations can be requested by affixing .html to an endpoint name and machine-readable representations can be requested by affixing .json.

If you think this experiment sounds like loads of fun, feel free to fork and run your own version.

The version in this repository can be accessed at the http://ryepdx.com/api endpoint.
